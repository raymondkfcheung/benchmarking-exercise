# PBA Assignment - POLKADOT-SDK / FRAME

## !! See [ASSIGNMENT.md](./ASSIGNMENT.md) for instructions to complete this assignment !!

## About This Template

This template is based on the `polkadot-sdk-minimal-template`. This is the most bare-bone template
that ships with `polkadot-sdk`, and most notably has no consensus mechanism. That is, any node in
the network can author blocks. This makes it possible to easily run a single-node network with any
block-time that we wish.

### ☯️ `omni-node`-only

Moreover, this template has been stripped to only contain the `runtime` part of the template. This
is because we provide you with an omni-node that can run this runtime. An `omni-node` is broadly a
substrate-based node that has no dependency to any given runtime, and can run a wide spectrum of
runtimes. The `omni-node` provided below is based on the aforementioned template and therefore has
no consensus engine baked into it.

## How to Run

### Individual Pallets

To test while developing, without a full build:

```sh
cargo t -p pallet-dpos
cargo t -p pallet-free-tx
cargo t -p pallet-multisig
cargo t -p pallet-treasury
```

### Entire Runtime

#### Using `omni-node`

First, make sure to install the special omni-node of the PBA assignment, if you have not done so
already from the previous activity.

```sh
cargo install polkadot-omni-node --locked
cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder --locked
```

Then build your runtime Wasm:

```sh
cargo build -p pba-runtime --release
```

Then create a chain-spec from that Wasm file:

```sh
chain-spec-builder create --runtime ./target/release/wbuild/pba-runtime/pba_runtime.wasm --relay-chain westend --para-id 1000 -t development default
```

Then load that chain-spec into the omninode:

```sh
polkadot-omni-node --chain chain_spec.json --dev-block-time 6000 --tmp
```

Populate your chain-spec file then with more accounts, like:

```json
// Find the existing, but empty `balances` key in the existing JSON, and update that.
"balances": {
  "balances": [
    ["5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY", 100000000000],
    ["5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty", 100000000000],
